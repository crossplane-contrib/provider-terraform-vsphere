# provider-terraform-vsphere

An experimental @crossplane provider for @vmware vSphere

This provider was generated by running https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/terraform-provider-gen
pointed at the plugin binary built from https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-vsphere

The same provider binary used to build the provider must also be present at runtime. Point the runtime at the
full path to the plugin on the local filesystem using the `--pluginPath=` cli flag. When using an official image
the appropriate plugin binary will be bundled.

## Demo

```
./hack/integration-test/setup.sh
./demo.sh
kubectl apply -f examples/controller-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f examples/provider.yaml
kubectl apply -f hack/integration-test/provider
kubectl apply -f hack/integration-test/resources
```
